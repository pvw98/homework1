At the beginning i implemented the skip conection layer. in later experiments i used the original resnet18.
Most of the dataset part is taken from the Random forest exercise with on ly slight adjustments.
Training was done on GPU T4 and only on a subset of the Dataset (like in the earlier exercise)
